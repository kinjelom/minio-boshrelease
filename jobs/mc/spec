      BASH script to run mc commands.

      The pre-configured host configuration is called 'THIS_MINIO'. For example,
      if you need to list buckets, you can write such code:

        `$MC_HOME/mc ls THIS_MINIO`
      
      Support for TLS-enabled minio server is provided with a pre-configured
      config folder that is available at '$CONFIG_DIR'. There is
      located the custom Certificate Authority certs that the 'mc' should
      trust. So, in a TLS-enabled server, the example bucket creation above
      becomes:
      
        `$MC_HOME/mc --config-dir $CONFIG_DIR ls THIS_MINIO`
      
      or 
      
        `$MC_HOME/mc --insecure ls THIS_MINIO`
